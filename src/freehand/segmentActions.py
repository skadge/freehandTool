class SegmentActions(object):
  '''
  GUI actions on ControlPoints of a SegmentString.
  
  Currently, only actions for a GUI where SegmentStrings are only cubic curves,
  and where:
  - the only action is translating (not deleting ControlPoints NOR expanding or rotating direction arms.)
  - moving a ControlPoint maintains cuspness depending on role of ControlPoint and pre-existence of cuspness.
  
  FIXME: delete actions
  Deleting ControlPoint would mean e.g. simplify curve to arc or straighten curve to line
  
  Pattern: Strategy
  =================
  !!! See singleton at end of file.
  FIXME: There could be more than one set of actions, for different GUI design.
  IE implement concrete subclasses of abstract SegmentActions.
  For example, a user preference: use action set from a competing app.
  
  Here, the Strategy caller is a SegmentString, which passes a *Context* which is the relations, etc. between ControlPoints.
  Does NOT pass a reference to the caller.
  
  TODO: 
  =====
  As is, when user moves a Direction CP, cuspness is created.
  To make cuspness dynamic, need to check and possibly restore cuspness (smoothness) after move direction point.
